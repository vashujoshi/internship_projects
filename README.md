 
  About project:-
   In this repo i made 2 projects:-
   1 is a chat app with help of vanilla js,websocket.io,html,css ,firebase ,express etc. 
   2 is a interactive story where the user can choose different options for infinitely ending his story .
   used -js,html,css.

 EXTRA-
Firebase authentication is working but has been made as a separate page and not used with the main project as it was causing issues with the project and making the main login page very complicated which was not looking good for a chatapp.

   
   
   
   
# How to run the chat app
   
   1 open server.js
   
    2.RUN in terminal -> npm run dev
